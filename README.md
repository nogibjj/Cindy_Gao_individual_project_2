# Individual Project 2: Rust CLI Binary with SQLite
## Project Overview

This project is a Rust-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application that integrates with mini project week8 and an SQLite database, demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The primary focus is to showcase Rust's unique features and syntax, while also highlighting how an LLM (Language Model) was used in the development process. The optimized Rust binary is generated using GitLab Actions, and a workflow file is provided for testing, building, and linting the code.

## Raw Data Resource
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/refs/heads/master/murder_2016/murder_2015_final.csv <br><br>
The dataset presents the numbers of murders in 2014 and 2015, grouped by different cities in the US. <br><br>

## Usage of Large Language Models
GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT both played key roles in developing this project. GitHub Copilot was particularly useful for converting Python functions to Rust, providing intelligent code suggestions and syntax adaptations for Rust, especially in areas like file handling, command-line parsing, and database operations. This made translating ETL functions and database queries from Python to Rust much more efficient.

ChatGPT was also utilized throughout the project for debugging, optimization, and refining complex logic in Rust. It assisted with troubleshooting errors, understanding Rust-specific best practices, and improving code performance.

## Usage of CRUD operations
Below are the commands available in the CLI for CRUD operations, implemented in `src/lib.rs`:

- **Create**:  
  Extracts data from a specified URL and creates new records in the database by saving the data in `Murder2015.db`.
  ```bash
  ./target/release/cindy_gao_individual_project_2 extract https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/murder_2016/murder_2015_final.csv data/murder_2015_final.csv
  ```
  
- **Read**:  
  Loads the data from a CSV file into the SQLite database, then retrieves and displays the top 5 records in the `Murder2015` table.
  ```bash
  ./target/release/cindy_gao_individual_project_2 load data/murder_2015_final.csv
  ./target/release/cindy_gao_individual_project_2 read_query
  ```

- **Update**:  
  Updates specific fields in the `Murder2015` table. For instance, it updates the `change` field to 60 for the city "Chicago."
  ```bash
  ./target/release/cindy_gao_individual_project_2 update_query
  ```

- **Delete**:  
  Deletes specific records from the database. In this case, it deletes the record where the city is "Chicago."
  ```bash
  ./target/release/cindy_gao_individual_project_2 delete_query
  ```

- **Sort by Change**:  
  Sorts the records in the `Murder2015` table by the `change` field and displays the `state` and `city` columns in sorted order.
  ```bash
  ./target/release/cindy_gao_individual_project_2 sorting_change
  ```
